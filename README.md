<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The Automated EDA Analysis project revolves around a web application designed to streamline the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for datasets. By integrating the power of data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib along with data manipulation using Pandas, this web application offers an efficient and intuitive platform for users to input datasets or choose from pre-loaded ones. The application provides comprehensive insights, including dataset components, univariate and bivariate analyses, and correlation plots, all in a user-friendly interface and automated manner.
